Function Exercise 2. 
In the exercises for the previous chapter, you wrote a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. 
Add a function to this program that solicits the user's first and last names in separate invocations; the function should return the appropriate name as a string. 
Use the return values to greet the user with their full name.

// let first = rlSync.question("What is your first name\?");
// let last = rlSync.question("What is your last name\?");




function getName(prompt) {
  let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
  let name = readlineSync.question(prompt);
  return name;
}

let firstName = getName('What is your first name? ');
let lastName = getName('What is your last name? ');
console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
