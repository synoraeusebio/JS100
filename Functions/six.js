Function Exercise 6. 

What does the following code log to the console?

*/

function scream(words) {    // define a function named scream with a single paramter called words 
  return words + '!!!!';    // return the argument and the string of exclamation points
}

scream('Yipeee');    		// call the function named scream and pass the single argument of Yipee when we call scream


// Nothing is logged to the console. Console.log isn't used as a way of printing anything to the console. 
// The program stops a the return statment.
