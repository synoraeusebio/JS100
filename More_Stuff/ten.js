More Stuff Exercise 10

Challenging Exercise This exercise has nothing to do with this chapter. Instead, it uses concepts you learned earlier in the book. If you can't figure out the answer, don't worry: this question can stump developers with more experience than you have.

Consider this code:


let x = "5";
x = x + 1;      // returns "51"



Now, consider this code:
let y = "5";
y++;



*/

// Result is 5. The post increment operator returns the orginal value, not 6.
